## [All State Insurance Claims Severity Prediction](https://github.com/shejz/Machine-Learning-Projects/tree/master/All%20State%20Insurance%20Claims%20Severity%20Prediction) [![Nbviewer](https://github.com/jupyter/design/blob/master/logos/Badges/nbviewer_badge.svg)](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/shejz/Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/master/All%20State%20Insurance%20Claims%20Severity%20Prediction/All%20State%20Insurance%20Claims%20Severity%20Prediction.ipynb)

In this data science project, you will develop automated methods for predicting the cost, and severity of insurance claims.

Description:

When you've been devastated by a serious car accident, your focus is on the things that matter the most: family, friends, and other loved ones. Pushing paper with your insurance agent is the last place you want your time or mental energy spent. This is why Allstate, a personal insurer in the United States, is continually seeking fresh ideas to improve their claims service for the over 16 million households they protect.

- Basic exploratory analysis using the claims data
- Insights from exploratory data analysis
- Factors to be considered for claims processing and severity prediction
- Implementation of the model using R
- Building smarter predictive models including **XGBoost**

## [Build an Image Classifier for Plant Species Identification](https://github.com/shejz/Machine-Learning-Projects/tree/master/Build%20an%20Image%20Classifier%20for%20Plant%20Species%20Identification)[![Nbviewer](https://github.com/jupyter/design/blob/master/logos/Badges/nbviewer_badge.svg)](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/shejz/Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/master/Build%20an%20Image%20Classifier%20for%20Plant%20Species%20Identification/Build%20an%20Image%20Classifier%20for%20Plant%20Species%20Identification.ipynb)

In this machine learning project, we will use binary leaf images and extracted features, including shape, margin, and texture to accurately identify plant species using different benchmark classification techniques.

Description:

The objective of this machine learning project is to use binary leaf images and extracted features, including shape, margin, and texture, to accurately identify 99 species of plants. Leaves, due to their volume, prevalence, and unique characteristics, are an effective means of differentiating plant species. They also provide a fun introduction to applying techniques that involve image-based features. We are going to apply different classification techniques to benchmark the relevance of classifiers in image classification problem.

- Image Processing
- Feature selection
- Classifier comparison
- Benchmarking
- Prediction


## [Choosing the right Time Series Forecasting Methods](https://github.com/shejz/Machine-Learning-Projects/tree/master/Choosing%20the%20right%20Time%20Series%20Forecasting%20Methods)[![Nbviewer](https://github.com/jupyter/design/blob/master/logos/Badges/nbviewer_badge.svg)](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/shejz/Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/master/Choosing%20the%20right%20Time%20Series%20Forecasting%20Methods/Time-Series-Forecasting.ipynb)

There are different time series forecasting methods to forecast stock price, demand etc. In this machine learning project, you will learn to determine which forecasting method to be used when and how to apply with time series forecasting example.

Description:

In this machine learning project, we will be taking open source datasets that are publicly available and will be discussing various methods/techniques of performing time series forecasting. We will discuss about the traditional methods such as holt-winters method, Autoregressive integrated moving average method, exponential smoothing methods, as well we will also be comparing the modern methods of performing forecasting using neural network based models.

- Understanding the importance of time series
- Understanding the mathematics of time series
- Discussion about methods/techniques
- Application of the models using R or Python
- Making conclusions

## [Credit Card Fraud Detection as a Classification Problem](https://github.com/shejz/Machine-Learning-Projects/tree/master/Credit%20Card%20Fraud%20Detection%20as%20a%20Classification%20Problem)[![Nbviewer](https://github.com/jupyter/design/blob/master/logos/Badges/nbviewer_badge.svg)](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/shejz/Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/master/Credit%20Card%20Fraud%20Detection%20as%20a%20Classification%20Problem/Credit%20Card%20Fraud%20Detection%20as%20a%20Classification%20Problem.ipynb) 
In this data science project, we will predict the credit card fraud in the transactional dataset using some of the predictive models.

- Handle imbalance data
- Creation classifier
- Compare accuracy
- Use deep learning to classify
- Implementation using R

The Credit Card Fraud detection Dataset contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders. This dataset present transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions.

The dataset has been collected and analyzed during a research collaboration of Worldline and the [Machine Learning Group](http://mlg.ulb.ac.be) of ULB (Universit√© Libre de Bruxelles) on big data mining and fraud detection. More details on current and past projects on related topics are available on http://mlg.ulb.ac.be/BruFence and http://mlg.ulb.ac.be/ARTML
