## [All State Insurance Claims Severity Prediction](https://github.com/shejz/Machine-Learning-Projects/tree/master/All%20State%20Insurance%20Claims%20Severity%20Prediction) [![Nbviewer](https://github.com/jupyter/design/blob/master/logos/Badges/nbviewer_badge.svg)](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/shejz/Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/master/All%20State%20Insurance%20Claims%20Severity%20Prediction/All%20State%20Insurance%20Claims%20Severity%20Prediction.ipynb)

In this data science project, you will develop automated methods for predicting the cost, and severity of insurance claims.

Description:

When you've been devastated by a serious car accident, your focus is on the things that matter the most: family, friends, and other loved ones. Pushing paper with your insurance agent is the last place you want your time or mental energy spent. This is why Allstate, a personal insurer in the United States, is continually seeking fresh ideas to improve their claims service for the over 16 million households they protect.

- Basic exploratory analysis using the claims data
- Insights from exploratory data analysis
- Factors to be considered for claims processing and severity prediction
- Implementation of the model using R
- Building smarter predictive models including **XGBoost**

## [Build an Image Classifier for Plant Species Identification](https://github.com/shejz/Machine-Learning-Projects/tree/master/Build%20an%20Image%20Classifier%20for%20Plant%20Species%20Identification)[![Nbviewer](https://github.com/jupyter/design/blob/master/logos/Badges/nbviewer_badge.svg)](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/shejz/Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/master/Build%20an%20Image%20Classifier%20for%20Plant%20Species%20Identification/Build%20an%20Image%20Classifier%20for%20Plant%20Species%20Identification.ipynb)

In this machine learning project, we will use binary leaf images and extracted features, including shape, margin, and texture to accurately identify plant species using different benchmark classification techniques.

Description:

The objective of this machine learning project is to use binary leaf images and extracted features, including shape, margin, and texture, to accurately identify 99 species of plants. Leaves, due to their volume, prevalence, and unique characteristics, are an effective means of differentiating plant species. They also provide a fun introduction to applying techniques that involve image-based features. We are going to apply different classification techniques to benchmark the relevance of classifiers in image classification problem.
